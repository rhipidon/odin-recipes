        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bone-in veal loin about 250 g of each about 5 mm thick (alternatively, you can choose 2 slices of boneless veal)</li>
            <li>2 small eggs</li>
            <li>breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>150 g clarified butter</li>
            <li>Maldon-type salt flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First with the help of a meat tenderizer flatten the slices a little so that they are about the same thickness.</li>
            <li>Then coat each cutlet in breadcrumbs, then in beaten egg and finally in breadcrumbs again, in order to obtain a homogeneous breadcrumb coating that is present in every part. Then press down well.</li>
            <li>Then heat a large frying pan with clarified butter. Wait until it melts to a not too high temperature and cook your ribs about 3 minutes per side. extend by 1 minute per side if you want them well done.
                Be sure to drizzle the bone with the hot butter as well with a spoon so that the meat cooks evenly everywhere.
                Reduce the cooking time to 1 minute per side if you have thin slices, or increase the time if your slices are quite thick .
                The end result must be a golden - caramelized color.</li>
            <li>Finally dust with salt and serve hot; in this case with arugula and cherry tomatoes previously seasoned with a drizzle of oil and salt.</li>
            <li>Here is your Cotoletta alla Milanese ready!</li>
        </ol>
